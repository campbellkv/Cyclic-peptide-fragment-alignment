# Cyclic-peptide-fragment-alignment
A way to identify cyclic peptide scaffold alignments to small fragments of PPIs

This script was based off of the hotloop alignment identification process done by Hosseinzadeh et al (2017) in their paper "Comprehensive computational design of ordered peptide macrocycles".

The goal of this project was to identify alignments of a massive set of scaffolds generated by Rettie et al (2023) to a set of PPI hotloops from the PDB generated by Gavenonis, J., Sheneman, B., Siegert, T. et al in their paper "Comprehensive analysis of loops at protein-protein interfaces for macrocycle design". 

For the purpose of this project and reducing computational time, the script is designed to break after 1 alignment is found for a hotloop, but the script can be modified to output all matches for a single interface.
